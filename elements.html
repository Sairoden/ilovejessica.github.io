							<h2>Dear Jessica,</h1>
								<p class="indenta">	As the new year is approaching, I want to take this as an opportunity to extend my heartfelt letter to you and appreciate you all for your kindness you gave to me this year. 
									It's been 5 months I think since we met when you were still in Korea. It was really so coincidence that we liked each other on the tinder, I can’t imagine not meeting you. 
									I liked how we have so many common in each other which made our bond tighter. When you were on a month of studying for your preparation for the exam and you were inactive on Instagram.
									 I thought I should do something to help you, but the thing is that I was so far away from you and I feel like I was powerless that I couldn't do anything for you so I thought I'll give you some daily motivation and some cute pics to help you motivated so that you could give your best and keep going. I was really happy that time when you finished your exam, I thought you could finally have the time to chat with me sometimes but then you become inactive for a month again. I actually thought that it was just normal but then as time goes on, I realized that I've fallen in love with you, but sadly I was thinking that you weren’t interested in me, but that didn’t stop me I was finding a way to open a message for you but I wasn't brave enough. My shyness overpowered me, but then I realized there will be nothing to afraid of if, it’s for the sake of love. I remembered by the time you replied it was so splendid that I was overjoyed and I looks like a crazy person getting excited and jumping around. I think, after that we messaged time to time and it was really fun talking with you. I like how the way you love kpop so much even though I’m new to it, you’re recommending me a lot of good ones. I love your story and want me to feel included in your adventures and life. I'm really looking forward to the day that I get to experience those adventures with you in person! Though many miles may separate us, I still feel so close to you. I'm incredibly lucky to have a girl who can make me feel that way from halfway across the world! There's truly no one else in the world I would rather spend my life with. There's no doubt that distance can be hard on a relationship, but I want to reassure you that distance can never weaken my love for you. You’re forever in my heart! You mean the world to me, and it's small wonder why, you’re the best thing that has ever happened to me! The day I met you was the luckiest day of my life, and I've cherished every day we've spent talking since. I promise to stay true to you and hold on you for as long as you let me. I’ll do everything I can to make you as happy as you can be by my side. I want to be there helping you at all times, I want to grow with you, to see how much we can do together. I want to help you achieve your dreams, and see them come to life.
									 I want to be there for you, when it all seems too much, I want to make you smile and laugh, to experience joy every day.
									 I want days filled with you, and I want to continue seeing you, in your weakest or your strongest, I want to be there with you. 
									I feel like I’m the king of the world right now because I found my queen. 
									This year wasn’t really great but I want to start this new year with you as my girl. Will you be my girlfriend?
								</p>
